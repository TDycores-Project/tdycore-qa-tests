Features:

 * 2D
 * Steady-state
 * Saturated groundwater flow
 * Linear pressure gradients at boundaries
 * Non-uniform block permeability

The 2D problem domain consists of a unit square divided into quadrants with a permeability of 10\ :sup:`-12`\  at the upper left and lower right and 10\ :sup:`-12`\  at the upper right and lower left. Dirichlet boundary conditions are assigned to all four sides of the domain with a linear gradient ranging between 1 MPa at the upper right and 3 MPa at the lower left.
